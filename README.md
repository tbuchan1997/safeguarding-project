## User Experience (UX)  
  
### **User Stories**  

### **Primary Goal**  
  
The Board Game Guardians wanted to create a straightforward webpage that outlines the key principles of safeguarding in the context of their club and community and uses clear, structured content. The layout needed to be simple and intuitive, making the information easy to access and understand.

### **Visitor Goals** 
The Board Game Guardians primary goal is provide information about safeguarding in a fun, relaxed environment. So, it was essential that information about what safeguarding is and how to report issues in the local area was easy to find, as well as club meetings times and locations. The site made use of responsive design to be easily accessible from any device. 

### **First Time Visitor**
  - A user can access each page of the site with one click via the navigation bar.
  - A user wanting information about safeguarding can find anything linked to safeguarding under the dropdown menu item labeled 'Safeguarding'.
  - A user can quickly be taken to guidelines on how to report a safeguarding issue from a dropdown in the navigation bar or cards in the main body.
  - A user can view contact information and reporting information in the footer.

### **Returning Visitor**  
  - A user can quickly access events from the menu bar or in the main body.
  - A user can find social media links in the footer to learn more about BGG.
  - A user can use the report/contact form to connect with the club.
  
### **Frequent Visitor**

## Creation Process  
  
### **1. Strategy**  


- I required an easy-to-read, dependable website that delivers clear information about safeguarding, reporting and meeting times. 
- Location of the meetings and social media links needed to be available.  
- The calm but playful aesthetic is to be carried on throughout the website with the use of consistent, clean design and use of graphics and colour to evoke an emotional and familiar connection for the user.  
- Reporting within the menu page is to be easy access and simple.  
- Mobile responsiveness is an essential feature required for this website.
  

### **2. Scope**  

The Board Game Guardians site must be available on a wide range of devices. The clumb members are a difuse variety of people from the local community. BGG provides a safe, welcoming, fun environment for its members and they wished for this to be reflected in the website.  

- The site is to contain only essential information, presented in a similar fashion and layout.   
- Text must be clear and legible on any sized device to allow the user instant access to the menu, location, and opening times.  
- A brief introduction to the purpose of the club to be included in the landing page.  
- For future development, a list of board games available to be brought to a meeting and a request system. 
  

### **3. Structural**  

It was requested that the design was straightforward, clear and easy to understand with the following features:
 
-A hero section that quicky and clearly describe the purpose of the website.
- Key information sections were to be included with sections explaining safeguarding, signs to watch for and action steps. 
- A form for contacting and reporting safeguarding concerns. 

  
### **4. Skeleton**  

The site was developed to be straightforward with details about safeguarding and reporting clearly signposted.  

- For the landing page, the logo, Board Game Guardians, was to be top-left of every page.  
- A four-item navigation bar of 'Home', 'Safeguarding', 'Outreach' and 'Contact', is situated always to the right of the logo. An underline feature identifying the current page and whether a cursor or touch was accurate.  Safeguarding has a dropdown menu with 'What is safeguarding', 'How to report' and 'Contact/Report to Us'.
- A large, clear vector image of friends playing a board game dominates the landing page. 
- Centered in the image is a tagline and slogan of the club, clearly explain the club and its purpose.
- Scrolling down the page introduces to slightly more indepth overview of what the club is and what they do. Underneath are information cards with images, a text description and buttons to lead to more information.
- The page ends with the footer with contact details, reporting information and social media links.
- For the contact page, the navigation bar and footer remain as before. Between these lies is a simple form with name, email and message fields with an attractive background. 
- For the safeguarding page, the navigation and footer remain as before. Two sections are presented with explanatory headings. Underneath is a video about safeguarding and an accordian with information about types of abuse, a definition, signs to watch for and some resources for within and without Lancashire.
-The outreach page has three cards to links to organisations the club has worked with or is working with. If these were real they would link to the organisations homepages.

### **5. Surface**  

 A design was created that allowed a consistent flow throughout the site.   
- A palette of light greens, pinks and oranges was created, similar to evoke a calm but playful feeling. 
- Two clean, sans-serif fonts, were used 'Montseratt' and 'Lexend'. Both of these are clear and nicely spaced making them readible for everyone.
- 
Overall, the design was intended and created to evoke a relaxing and safe environment.
 
 ## Design  

### **Color Scheme**  

This website used a fresh palette of greens, pinks and oranges that were inspired by the hero image.  I combined these with a darker licorice colour for contrast and readabilty in the text.
  
![colour theme swatches](docs/color-p.png)  
   
  
[Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) checked how accessible the colours are.  

### **Typography**  
  
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the fonts 'Montseratt' and 'Lexend'. I used Montseratt for headings and Lexend for the main content.
  
### **Imagery**  
 
 I specifically chose graphic vector images over photographs as I felt this was a bit safer with the safeguarding theme, where photographs of people can be problematic. The clear, bright hero image was a great foundation for building the theme of the website and all other images used this one as a reference point when generated in AI. Each information card in the main section of the site is topped by it's own themed image and other backgrounds are vector graphics of the Preston skyline and Miller Park (contact page background).

The sites [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/uk/) and Adobe Firefly provided the stock and AI images used throughout the website, with attributions to the designers placed in the [Credits](#credits) section of this README doc.

This remains the same across all pages in tablet/desktop view, it changes to a hamburger icon in the center for mobile views. The logo text also resizes to smaller for mobile.

I made use of bootstrap cards to present introductory information about the club with 'Who are We?' and 'What do we do?'. Underneath these are the primary information cards with an image, title, and description followed by a 'learn more' button.

Here any events can be added and will wrap as needed. The background is a gaphic image of the Preston skyline, with a dark overlay to make the event information more readable. Each event is seperated with a border.

## Tablet & Mobile View  
 
### **Desktop, Tablet & Mobile Differences**  

To ensure responsivity I used Bootstrap 4.6. All elements resize and wrap as necessary, with everything appearing in a column for smaller screens. The header navbar and logo changed as detailed above.
