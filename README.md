[View live project here on GitHub](https://github.io/tbuchan1997/safeguaridng-project)

The **Safeguarding Information Hub** is a digital resource dedicated to promoting awareness and best practices in safeguarding. Aimed at individuals, families, and communities seeking to understand and engage with safeguarding issues, the hub serves as an accessible platform for essential guidance and education. Beyond simply providing information, the **Safeguarding Information Hub** empowers users to take proactive steps in protecting themselves and others by offering resources on identifying and addressing potential risks. Through the use of practical advice, the hub fosters a collective responsibility towards safety and respect, creating a supportive, informed environment for everyone.

## User Experience (UX)  
  
### **User Stories**  

As a user, I want to access a contact section with relevant details so that I can report safeguarding concerns quickly if needed.

As a user, I want to see a bold and clear introductory message so that I immediately understand the importance of safeguarding when I land on the page.

As a user, I want to quickly access key safeguarding principles so that I can understand what safeguarding involves and why it matters.

As a site owner, I want to present a hero section with a bold heading and a relevant image or background so that the website immediately captures the user's attention and communicates the significance of safeguarding.

As a user, I want to find a clear, step-by-step guide for recognizing and responding to safeguarding concerns so that I know what actions to take if I encounter a safeguarding issue.

As a user, I want a color-coded visual hierarchy for different sections so that it is easier to follow the flow of information.

## Creation Process  
  
### **1. Strategy**  


- I required an easy-to-read, dependable website that delivers clear information about safeguarding, reporting and meeting times.  
- Reporting within the menu page is to be easy access and simple.  
- Mobile responsiveness is an essential feature required for this website.
  

### **2. Scope**  

The Safeguarding information site must be available on a wide range of devices. 

- The site is to contain only relevant information, presented in a consistent fashion and layout.   
- Text must be clear and legible on any sized device to allow the user instant access to the menu, form and all information.  
- A brief introduction to the purpose of the website to be included in the landing page.
  

### **3. Structural**  

It was requested that the design was straightforward, clear and easy to understand with the following features:
 
-A hero section that quicky and clearly describe the purpose of the website.
- Key information sections were to be included with sections explaining safeguarding, signs to watch for and action steps. 
- A form for reporting safeguarding concerns. 

  
### **4. Skeleton**  

The site was developed to be straightforward with details about safeguarding and reporting clearly signposted.  
 
- A four-item navigation bar of 'Home', 'Identify', 'Resources' and 'Report a Concern', is at the top of the screen. An enlarge feature identifying the current page and colour change whether a cursor or touch was accurate.  On smaller screens the menu collapses into an accordion.
- A large, clear image dominates the landing page. 
- Centered in the image is a blurb explaining the purpose of the website.
- Scrolling down the page introduces to slightly more indepth overview of what safeguarding is.
- The page ends with the footer with contact details and social media links.
- For the contact page, the navigation bar and footer remain as before. There is a form with text, date, time inputs plus a dropdown menu and radio buttons.
- For the identify page, the navigation and footer remain as before. Two sections are presented with explanatory headings. Underneath is detailed information regarding basic safeguarding procedures
-The additional resources page has multiple cards to links to real organisations with blurb taken from their websites.

### Wireframes  

Wireframes are available [here](/assets/wireframes)

### **5. Surface**  

 A design was created that allowed a consistent flow throughout the site. 
- Two clean, sans-serif fonts, were used 'Lora' and 'Roboto'. Both of these are clear and nicely spaced making them readible for everyone.
- 
Overall, the design was intended and created to evoke a safe and professional environment.
 
 ## Design  

### **Color Scheme**  

This website used a fresh palette of browns and peach that were inspired by the hero image.  I combined these with a white text colour for sufficient contrast
  
![colour theme swatches](docs/color-p.png)  
   
  
[Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) checked how accessible the colours are.  

### **Typography**  
  
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the fonts 'Montseratt' and 'Lexend'. I used Montseratt for headings and Lexend for the main content.
  
### **Imagery**  
 
 I specifically chose graphic vector images over photographs as I felt this was a bit safer with the safeguarding theme, where photographs of people can be problematic. The clear, bright hero image was a great foundation for building the theme of the website and all other images used this one as a reference point when generated in AI. Each information card in the main section of the site is topped by it's own themed image and other backgrounds are vector graphics of the Preston skyline and Miller Park (contact page background).

The sites [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/uk/) and Adobe Firefly provided the stock and AI images used throughout the website, with attributions to the designers placed in the [Credits](#credits) section of this README doc.

## Tablet & Mobile View  
 
### **Desktop, Tablet & Mobile Differences**  

To ensure responsivity I used Bootstrap 5. All elements resize and wrap as necessary, with everything appearing in a column for smaller screens. The header navbar and logo changed as detailed above.

## Future Features  

- For future development, I would like to incorporate a more in depth list of resources, make the am I a robot form validation real.

## Deployment

### **How to deploy**  

GitHub was used to deploy the website. These were the steps taken to acheive this:  

1. Login to GitHub account
2. Navigate to the project repository, safeguarding-project
3. Click the Settings button near the top of the page
4. In the left-hand menu, find and click on the Pages button
5. In the Source section, choose 'main' from the drop-down, select branch menu
6. Select 'root' from the drop-down folder menu
7. Click 'Save' and after a few moments the project will have been made live and a link is visible at the top of the page


### **Initial testing plan**

I had planned for this site to be accessible and legible on all screen sizes. I used Chrome Dev Tools to test, adjust and debug in the early stages.

### **Testing**    

Testing took place throughout the entire build using Dev Tools on Firefox and on the above real-world devices.

### **HTML Validation using W3C Validation**  

 Code validation is available [here](/assets/validation)
