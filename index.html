                            <p>Safeguarding is the process of protecting individuals, especially children, young people,
                                and
                                vulnerable adults, from abuse, harm, and neglect. It encompasses a range of measures
                                aimed at
                                ensuring their safety, well-being, and human rights are respected. This includes
                                preventing abuse
                                before it happens, responding effectively to incidents when they occur, and promoting a
                                culture of
                                safety in all settings.</p>

                            <p>Safeguarding is crucial because it helps create environments where individuals can live,
                                learn, and
                                grow without fear. It ensures that the most vulnerable members of society are protected
                                from harm
                                and can lead fulfilling lives. By understanding the signs of abuse, knowing how to
                                report concerns,
                                and implementing protective measures, we can work together to prevent harm and support

                                be at risk. Safeguarding is not just the responsibility of professionals; it is a shared

                                requires community awareness and proactive action.</p>

                                        across all sectors.</p>

                                    <strong>Accountability</strong>
                                    <p>There must be clear roles and responsibilities for safeguarding to ensure
                                        transparency
                                        and
                                        accountability. This principle involves making sure that everyone understands
                                        their role
                                        in
                                        safeguarding and is held responsible for their actions. Proper record-keeping,
                                        regular
                                        reviews, and adherence to safeguarding policies help maintain high standards and
                                        improve
